# Welcome to React﹤Kitten﹥

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build beatiful windowed applications with React﹤Kitten﹥.

Kitten is a Desktop Environment &amp; Window Manager for React. It provides a set of components and hooks to build windowed applications with ease.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple windowed application with React﹤Kitten﹥.

> In this tutorial, you'll see also API references for each component and hook. Please follow the tutorial step by step to understand how to use them.

Let's get started!

## Install React﹤Kitten﹥

To get started, you need to install React﹤Kitten﹥. You can install it using npm or yarn in your existing React project.

```bash
npm install react-kitten
```

That's all! Now you are ready to build your first windowed application with React﹤Kitten﹥.

This first example shows how to create a simple windowed application with React﹤Kitten﹥.

We are using `BasicWindow` in this first simple example. `BasicWindow` works with initial props; it is an easier way if you need a very basic window.

```tsx
function App() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState<[number, number]>([
    window.innerWidth,
    window.innerHeight,
  ])
  const [space, setSpace] = useState(0)

  return <Manager size={size}>
    <Spaces space={space} onSpaceChange={setSpace}>
      <Space>
        <BasicWindow>Hello World!</BasicWindow>
      </Space>
    </Spaces>
  </Manager>
}
```

In this example, we are using `Manager`, `Spaces`, `Space`, and `BasicWindow` components. `Manager` is the main componenet *(like "Window Manager")*, `Spaces` is the container for `Space` components, `Space` is the container for any elements including `Window` and `BasicWindow` components.

That's all! You have built your first windowed application with React﹤Kitten﹥.
